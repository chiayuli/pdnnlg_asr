### swbd ###
swbd folder includes the recipes of training DNN/CNN/CNN_LACEA based Acoustic Models with SWBD Data Set for ASR system.
In contains
	run_swbd_pdnnlg/  
	pdnnlg/ 
	steps_pdnnlg/ 

Please copy all three folders under Kaldi-trunck/egs/swbd/s5c/ , and follow these steps:
	1) Download/Install Kaldi
	2) Use $KALDI_ROOT/egs/swbd/s5c/run.sh recipe to get HMM-GMM SAT model (tri4) 
	3) Use run_swbd_pdnnlg/run-dnn.sh recipe to train HMM-DNN model, and get transcription and WER result
	       run_swbd_pdnnlg/run-dnn-fbank.sh recipe to train HMM-DNN model with fbank, and get transcription and WER result
	       run_swbd_pdnnlg/run-cnn.sh recipe to train HMM-CNN model, and get transcription and WER result
	       run_swbd_pdnnlg/run-cnn-lacea.sh recipe to train HMM-CNN-LACEA model, and get transcription and WER result
